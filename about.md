My name is Nelson Kimaiga, a web developer. In the web world, I'm the author of
The Rhapsody blog. Ideally, I don't design sites, I make them work.
My expertise and interest lies in front-end technologies, including HTML/5,
CSS, JavaScript..
My server side skills revolve around JSP(Java Servlets) and Python.
I also focus on open source contributing and pro-bono, as they open a world
of possibilities and rewards for their hard-working developers.
